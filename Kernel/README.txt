# Kernel part of the cuda-convnet code.
# 
# Under this folder there are four folders:
# 
# 1. matrix (includes the CPU implementation of the matrix data structure).
# 2. nvmatrix (includes the GPU implementation of the matrix data structure).
# 3. conv (includes GPU convolution code, which is base on the nvmatrix data structure).
# 4. layers (includes the layers, neurons, weights and cost data structures, which is used to build the convolutional net).
# 5. data (abstract data structure to represent the training and testing data feed to the neuron net).
